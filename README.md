# Startup Ideas ðŸ¤”

Here are some startup ideas I've been considering, as well as some notes on them. If you're excited about one of these ideas and want to work with me on it, please reach out via the internet :)

Most of these ideas come from problems that I've had in the past, and products I wish had existed when I had to deal with them. These are things I'd be happy to pay a monthly fee to use, provided they did what they promised.

### Stock broker for people who write code

* Create an API that provides free market data and an interface to programmatically trade stocks/ETFs/options/futures
* Provide a VSCode-based code editor for managing your trading algos
* Provide free cloud hosting to run your algos
* Sell order flow data direct to MMs like Citadel (same business model as Robinhood)
* Upsell advanced features, margin, algo templates, etc
* HFaaS: Hedge fund as a Service

### Book recommendation service

* Basically the same thing as goodreads but without the Amazon taint
* Allow people to enter in the kind of books they enjoy, and we use ML to make suggestions about what do read
* Allow people to submit reviews for books, without Amazon review jacking (we'll aggressively block spam and fake reviews)

### Data mover service

* Service for copying data between various sources and sinks (e.g., FTP -> S3)
* Allow scheduled flows (i.e., cron jobs)
* Provide endpoints for streaming data which can be written out to sinks or streamed somewhere else
* Provide transformations like JSON -> Parquet or CSV -> JSON or whatever

### Code as a Service

* Like mechanical turk, but for code
* Hire real life people by the hour to produce code according to your specifications
* Specify function inputs and outputs, get a snippet of code

### Kubernetes deployment manager

* A good tool for management k8s deployments
* This is mostly a b2b enterprise play
* There are already a lot of players in this space, but every tool I've tried sucks

### Dinner meetups

* Basically like meetup.com except you go to a restaurant for a prix fixe meal
* Pay ahead of time, show up, dine and enjoy a good conversation with interesting people around a theme of some kind, organized by anyone 

### Video

* Brand new youtube/twitch alternative that has a fresh, simple, clean UI/UX
* Biggest barrier to entry is the cost of storage/bandwidth for video
* Dealing with copyright violations is a big challenge
* Consider a subscription model similar to Substack, with generous payments for content creators
* Try to onboard big name youtubers, podcasters
